Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows Error Reporting (WER) can be configured so 
that full user-mode dumps are collected and stored locally after a user-mode application crashes. 
 
This feature is not enabled by default. Enabling the feature requires administrator privileges. To enable and configure the feature, 
use the following registry values under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps key. 

 
DumpFolder            REG_EXPAND_SZ   Path where dump files must be stored 
DumpCount             REG_DWORD       Number of dumps to keep 
DumpType              REG_DWORD       0 - Custom Dump 
                                      1 - Mini Dump 
                                      2 - Full Dump 
CustomDumpFlags       REG_DWORD       Refer link for details 

These registry values represent the global settings. You can also provide per-application settings that override the global settings.
To create a per-application setting, create a new key for your application under 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps
(for example, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\MyApplication.exe).
Add your dump settings under the MyApplication.exe key. If your application crashes, WER will first read the global settings, 
and then will override any of the settings with your application-specific settings.
