On the Target Virtual Machine (Debuggee) 
========================================

Follow the below steps to create a serial port on the Target Virtual Machine. 
* Power down the Virtual Machine. 
* Once powered down, go to Virtual Machine Settings dialog by clicking on "VM" and then "Settings" 
* Under "Hardware" tab, select "Serial Port". Then click on "Add…" button. 
* This will create a Serial port. 
* In the Port properties page, do following actions: 
  Select "Connect at power on" in "Device status" section.
  Select "Use named pipe:" option.  
  In the name editor of the "Use named pipe:", enter "\\.\pipe\com1" 
  Select "This end is the server." in the first drop down. 
  Select "The other end is an application." in the second drop down. 
  Select "Yield CPU on poll" in I/O mode section. 
* Select "Ok" to save the settings 
* If you get any error saying the port is in use in another server, make sure that no other Virtual Machine which is configured a Serial Port with this name is running. 

Now, reboot the Virtual Machine and perform following steps. 
Configuring required "dbgsettings" on the Target Virtual Machine. 
* Open command prompt with elevated privileges ( Run as Administrator) 
* Enable debugging on the target machine using the command "bcdedit /debug on" 
* Specify the debug settings using the command: "bcdedit /dbgsettings serial debugport:1 baudrate:115200" 
* In the above command, you must make sure that the "debugport" is the serial port number created on the virtual machine that is mapped to the named pipe. 
* You can verify the settings by running the command: "bcdedit /dbgsettings" 

Now, again, reboot the Virtual Machine. Once rebooted, Virtual Machine is ready for debugging. 

On the Host Virtual/Physical Machine (Debugger) 
===============================================

Follow the below steps to connect to the Target Virtual Machine from the WinDBG. 
* Start WinDBG, select "File" and then select "Kernel Debug…" 
* Select "COM" option, and enter the following details: 
  In Baud Rate, enter the baud rate  (115200) you have entered on the Target Virtual Machine. 
  In Port, enter the port name "\\.\pipe\com1" 
  Select "Pipe" check box. 
  Click "Ok.  
* Once clicked on "Ok", wait for the WinDBG to connect to target machine.
