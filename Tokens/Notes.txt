Different ways to get Tokens
----------------------------
Token creation with LogonUser
Token from Session
Token from Logon Session
Token from Process

There is no way to enumerate all the access tokens in the system

Token Access Rights
------------------
* TOKEN_ADJUST_SESSIONID  - This is required to change session id of token. Generally this is required when we have token from a particlar session 
                            and we want to create a process in different session with that same token. Like starting a SYSTEM process in a user session
                            from a service. We get service token, duplicate it, change session id and then create a new process with 
                            CreateProcessAsUser
                          - Getting this security access right requires SE_TCB_NAME privilege. Generally this privilge is only enabled for SYSTEM 
                            account. But can be enabled for other users/groups by administrator.
TOKEN_ASSIGN_PRIMARY      - Requires to attach primary token to a process. i.e. creating a new process with CreateProcessAsUser.
