Different ways to get Tokens
----------------------------
Token creation with LogonUser
  - LogonUser, LsaLogonUser
Token from Session
  - WTSQueryUserToken - Needs SeTcbPrivilege)
Token from Logon Session
  - ??
Token from Process
  - OpenProcessToken
  - GetCurrentProcessToken
  
Token Types (Primary / Impersonation Token)
---------------------------------------------------
* The token that is assigned to process when it is created is called 'Primary Token'. This token can be retrived with GetProcesToken or GetCurrentProcessToken. The TOKEN_TYPE of the process token will always be TokenPrimary.
* A primary token can be created from another primary/impersonation token using DuplicateTokenEx
* In most of the cases, threads does not have tokens of their own. When ever a thread tries to access as secure object, process primary token is used to check the access. If a thread does not have a token of its own, function OpenThreadToken fails with ERROR_NO_TOKEN (1008 - GetLastError).
However, there is a facility where a thread can have a different token than the process primiary token. ImpersonalLoggedOnUser can be used to assign separte token to the thread. This token is called 'Impersonation Token'. The TOKEN_TYPE for the token returned by OpenThreadToken will be TokenImpersonation.
* Impersonation Token can be created from another primary/impersonation token using DuplicateToken/DuplicateTokenEx

Token Access Rights
-------------------
* TOKEN_ADJUST_SESSIONID  - This is required to change session id of token. Generally this is required when we have token from a particlar session 
                            and we want to create a process in different session with that same token. Like starting a SYSTEM process in a 
                            user sessionfrom a service. We get service token, duplicate it, change session id and then create a new process with 
                            CreateProcessAsUser
                          - Getting this security access right requires SE_TCB_NAME privilege. Generally this privilge is only enabled for SYSTEM 
                            account. But can be enabled for other users/groups by administrator.
TOKEN_ASSIGN_PRIMARY      - Requires to attach primary token to a process. i.e. creating a new process with CreateProcessAsUser.
