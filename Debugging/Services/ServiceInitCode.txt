===========================================

REGISTRY MODIFICATION: On the System that is starting the service, create the following registry key: 
* HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<ProgramName> 
  Here program name is the name of the service application executable name including extension (Ex: RadarS.exe) 
* Create a string data value named "Debugger" under the above key.  Value of the string should be as follows: 
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\ntsd.exe" -server tcp:port=55555 -noio 
  Here, first parameter is the full path of the ntsd.exe debugger. Part can be changed to any available value. 

SYMBOL FILES: 
* Copy the symbol file in the directory where exe file resides. 
* Start the service with 'sc start' command.

==================================================================
 
* Open Windbg.exe 
* From 'Files' -> 'Connection to Remote Sessionsâ€¦." 
* Type the following the Connection String editor. 
  tcp:server=<serverIP>,port=<portnumber> 
* Clicking OK should make a connection with the server.
