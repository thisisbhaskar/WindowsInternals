The primary goal of UAC is to make the default user token that applications are run with mimic that of a member of the Users group.
This starts with creating a restricted, or filtered, token during interactive logon for users with elevated privileges.
When more privileges are necessary to execute a restricted operation, the user will be prompted for authorization on the 
secure desktop. UAC also includes other technologies to support application compatibility and to secure the elevated processes.
