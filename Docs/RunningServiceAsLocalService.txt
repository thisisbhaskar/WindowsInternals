Considerations to run service as "Local Service/Network Service" account:
=========================================================================

* No files should be written to inside Program Files/Windows. Only Admins are allowed to write to files inside Program Files.
  All application specific data like config/logs/temp files/etc.. must be moved to ProgramData??
  
* Cannot create any service or start any drivers in the code. All of this must be moved to installer.

* "Local Service" is not part of "Administrators" group, so it has limited privileges. Hence, cannot perform any operations in the code 
  that require those specical privileges

*
