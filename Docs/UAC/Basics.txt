The primary goal of UAC is to make the default user token that applications are run with mimic that of a member of the Users group.
This starts with creating a restricted, or filtered, token during interactive logon for users with elevated privileges.
When more privileges are necessary to execute a restricted operation, the user will be prompted for authorization on the 
secure desktop. UAC also includes other technologies to support application compatibility and to secure the elevated processes.

Who Creates Split Tokens : 
------------------------

LSA creates two tokens if the unfiltered (original) token built has either following groups or privileges.
LSA users a version of CreateRestrictedToken to create filterd token.
These two tokens are linked and the fully privileged token can be obtained from the filtered token using the GetTokenInformation API with 
the new TokenLinkedToken information type.
