7. SE_TCB_NAME                                  TEXT("SeTcbPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Act as part of the operating system'

The Act as part of the operating system policy setting determines whether a process can assume the identity of any user and thereby gain access to the resources that the user is authorized to access. Typically, only low-level authentication services require this user right. Potential access is not limited to what is associated with the user by default. The calling process may request that arbitrary additional privileges be added to the access token. The calling process may also build an access token that does not provide a primary identity for auditing in the system event logs.

Restrict the Act as part of the operating system user right to as few accounts as possible—it should not even be assigned to the Administrators group under typical circumstances. When a service requires this user right, configure the service to log on with the Local System account, which inherently includes this privilege. Do not create a separate account and assign this user right to it.

8. SE_SECURITY_NAME                             TEXT("SeSecurityPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Manage auditing and security log'

MSDN:

"A process must have the SeSecurityPrivilege privilege to manage the security Event Log and to view or set an object’s SACL. Processes that call audit system services, however, must have the SeAuditPrivilege privilege to successfully generate an audit record."

"This policy setting determines which users can specify object access audit options for individual resources such as
files, Active Directory objects, and registry keys. These objects specify their system access control lists (SACL). A
user who is assigned this user right can also view and clear the Security log in Event Viewer."

"Anyone with the Manage auditing and security log user right can clear the Security log to erase important
evidence of unauthorized activity"

9. SE_TAKE_OWNERSHIP_NAME                       TEXT("SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Take ownership of files or other objects'

This policy setting determines which users can take ownership of any securable object in the device, including Active Directory objects, NTFS files and folders, printers, registry keys, services, processes, and threads.

Every object has an owner, whether the object resides in an NTFS volume or Active Directory database. The owner controls how permissions are set on the object and to whom permissions are granted.

By default, the owner is the person who or the process which created the object. Owners can always change permissions to objects, even when they are denied all access to the object.

Any users with the Take ownership of files or other objects user right can take control of any object, regardless of the permissions on that object, and then make any changes that they want to make to that object. Such changes could result in exposure of data, corruption of data, or a denial-of-service condition.

11. SE_SYSTEM_PROFILE_NAME                       TEXT("SeSystemProfilePrivilege")
================================================================================

'Profile system performance'

This security setting determines which users can use Windows performance monitoring tools to monitor the
performance of system processes.

The Profile system performance user right poses a moderate vulnerability. Attackers with this user right could
monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes that they might want to attack directly.
Attackers might also be able to determine what processes are active on the computer so that they could identify
countermeasures to avoid, such as anti-virus software or an intrusion detection system.

12. SE_SYSTEMTIME_NAME                           TEXT("SeSystemtimePrivilege")
================================================================================

'Change the system time' privilege

This policy setting determines which users can adjust the time on the device's internal clock. This right allows the computer user to change the date and time associated with records in the event logs, database transactions, and the file system. This right is also required by the process that performs time synchronization. This setting does not impact the user’s ability to change the time zone or other display characteristics of the system time. 

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/change-the-system-time

13. SE_PROF_SINGLE_PROCESS_NAME                  TEXT("SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Profile single process'

This policy setting determines which users can view a sample performance of an application process. Typically, you don't need this user right to use the performance reporting tools included in the operating system. However, you do need this user right if the system’s monitor components are configured to collect data through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

The Profile single process user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Attackers with this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes that they might want to attack directly. Attackers may be able to determine what processes run on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures that they may need to avoid, such as anti-virus software or an intrusion-detection system. They could also identify other users who are logged on to a computer.

14. SE_INC_BASE_PRIORITY_NAME                    TEXT("SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Increase scheduling priority'

This policy setting determines which user accounts can increase the base priority class of a process. It is not a privileged operation to increase relative priority within a priority class. This user right is not required by administrative tools that are supplied with the operating system, but it might be required by software development tools.

Specifically, this security setting determines which accounts can use a process with Write Property access to another process to increase the run priority that is assigned to the other process. A user with this privilege can change the scheduling priority of a process through the Task Manager user interface.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/increase-scheduling-priority

15. SE_CREATE_PAGEFILE_NAME                      TEXT("SeCreatePagefilePrivilege")
================================================================================

'Create a pagefile'

Windows designates a section of the hard drive as virtual memory known as the page file, or more specifically, as
pagefile.sys. It is used to supplement the computer’s Random Access Memory (RAM) to improve performance for
programs and data that are used frequently. Although the file is hidden from browsing, you can manage it using
the system settings.
This policy setting determines which users can create and change the size of a page file. It determines whether
users can specify a page file size for a particular drive in the Performance Options box located on the Advanced
tab of the S ystem Proper ties dialog box or through using internal application interfaces (APIs).

16. SE_CREATE_PERMANENT_NAME                     TEXT("SeCreatePermanentPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Create permanent shared objects'

This user right determines which accounts can be used by processes to create a directory object by using the object
manager. Directory objects include Active Directory objects, files and folders, printers, registry keys, processes, and
threads. Users who have this capability can create permanent shared objects, including devices, semaphores, and
mutexes. This user right is useful to kernel-mode components that extend the object namespace. Because
components that are running in kernel-mode inherently have this user right assigned to them, it is not necessary to
specifically assign it.

https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/wiki/page.aspx?spid=CreatePermObj

17. SE_BACKUP_NAME                               TEXT("SeBackupPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Back up files and directories'

This user right determines which users can bypass file and directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions for the purposes of backing up the system. This user right is effective only when an application attempts access through the NTFS backup application programming interface (API) through a tool such as NTBACKUP.EXE. Otherwise, standard file and directory permissions apply.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/back-up-files-and-directories

18. SE_RESTORE_NAME                              TEXT("SeRestorePrivilege")
================================================================================

'Restore files and directories'

This security setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions when they restore backed up files and directories, and it determines which users can set valid security principals as the owner of an object.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/restore-files-and-directories

19. SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME                             TEXT("SeShutdownPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Shut down the system'

This security setting determines if a user who is logged on locally to a device can shut down Windows.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/shut-down-the-system

20. SE_DEBUG_NAME                                TEXT("SeDebugPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Debug programs'

This policy setting determines which users can attach to or open any process, even a process they do not own. Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need this user right. Developers who are debugging new system components need this user right. This user right provides access to sensitive and critical operating-system components.

The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive device information from system memory or to access and modify kernel or application structures. Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private security information or to insert malware. By default, the Debug programs user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps mitigate risk from this vulnerability.

22. SE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_NAME                   TEXT("SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Modify firmware environment values'

This security setting determines who can modify firmware environment values. Firmware environment values are
settings that are stored in the nonvolatile RAM of non-x86-based computers. The effect of the setting depends on
the processor.

23. SE_CHANGE_NOTIFY_NAME                        TEXT("SeChangeNotifyPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Bypass traverse checking'

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/bypass-traverse-checking

This policy setting determines which users (or a process that acts on behalf of the user’s account) have permission to navigate an object path in the NTFS file system or in the registry without being checked for the Traverse Folder special access permission. This user right does not allow the user to list the contents of a folder. It only allows the user to traverse folders to access permitted files or subfolders.

24. SE_REMOTE_SHUTDOWN_NAME                      TEXT("SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Force shutdown from a remote system'

This security setting determines which users are allowed to shut down a device from a remote location on the
network. This allows members of the Administrators group or specific users to manage computers (for tasks such
as a restart) from a remote location.

To shutdown remote system:
-------------------------
net use \\remote-host\ipc$ password /u:username
shutdown /r /m \\remote-host

For above command to work, create reg key 'LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy' as described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/user-account-control-and-remote-restriction

25. SE_UNDOCK_NAME                               TEXT("SeUndockPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Remove computer from docking station'

This security setting determines whether a user can undock a portable device from its docking station without logging on. This policy setting only affects scenarios that involve a portable computer and its docking station. If this user right is assigned to the user’s account (or if the user is a member of the assigned group), the user must log on before removing the portable device from its docking station. Otherwise, as a security measure, the user will not be able to log on after the device is removed from the docking station. If this policy is not assigned, the user may remove the portable device from its docking station without logging on, and then have the ability to start and log on to the device afterwards in its undocked state.

Anyone who has the Remove computer from docking station user right can log on and then remove a portable device from its docking station.

26. SE_SYNC_AGENT_NAME                           TEXT("SeSyncAgentPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Synchronize directory service data'

This policy setting determines which users and groups have authority to synchronize all directory service data, regardless of the protection for objects and properties. This privilege is required to use LDAP directory synchronization (dirsync) services. Domain controllers have this user right inherently because the synchronization process runs in the context of the System account on domain controllers.

28. SE_MANAGE_VOLUME_NAME                        TEXT("SeManageVolumePrivilege")
================================================================================

'Perform volume maintenance tasks'

This policy setting determines which users can perform volume or disk management tasks, such as defragmenting
an existing volume, creating or removing volumes, and running the Disk Cleanup tool.
Use caution when assigning this user right. Users with this user right can explore disks and extend files in to
memory that contains other data. When the extended files are opened, the user might be able to read and modify
the acquired data.

30. SE_CREATE_GLOBAL_NAME                        TEXT("SeCreateGlobalPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Create global objects'

This policy setting determines which users can create global objects that are available to all sessions. Users can still
create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not have this user right.
A global object is an object that is created to be used by any number of processes or threads, even those not
started within the user’s session. Remote Desktop Services uses global objects in its processes to facilitate
connections and access.

31. SE_TRUSTED_CREDMAN_ACCESS_NAME               TEXT("SeTrustedCredManAccessPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller'

The Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller policy setting is used by Credential Manager during backup and restore. No accounts should have this privilege because it's assigned only to the Winlogon service. Saved credentials of users may be compromised if this privilege is given to other entities.

33. SE_INC_WORKING_SET_NAME                      TEXT("SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege")
================================================================================

Required to increase working set of processes (SetProcessWorkingSetSize)

This policy setting determines which users can increase or decrease the size of the working set of a process. The working set of a process is the set of memory pages currently visible to the process in physical RAM. These pages are resident, and they are available for an application to use without triggering a page fault. The minimum and maximum working set sizes affect the virtual memory paging behavior of a process.

Increasing the working set size for a process decreases the amount of physical memory that is available to the rest of the system.

34. SE_TIME_ZONE_NAME                            TEXT("SeTimeZonePrivilege")
================================================================================

'Change the time zone'

This policy setting determines which users can adjust the time zone that is used by the device for displaying the local time, which includes the device's system time plus the time zone offset.

Changing the time zone represents little vulnerability because the system time is not affected. This setting merely enables users to display their preferred time zone while being synchronized with domain controllers in different time zones.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/change-the-time-zone

35. SE_CREATE_SYMBOLIC_LINK_NAME                 TEXT("SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege")
================================================================================

'Create symbolic links'

A symbolic link is a file-system object that points to another file-system object. The object that's pointed to is called the target. Symbolic links are transparent to users. The links appear as normal files or directories, and they can be acted upon by the user or application in exactly the same manner. Symbolic links are designed to aid in migration and application compatibility with UNIX operating systems. Microsoft has implemented symbolic links to function just like UNIX links.

Users who have the Create symbolic links user right could inadvertently or maliciously expose your system to symbolic link attacks. Symbolic link attacks can be used to change the permissions on a file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a DoS attack.
